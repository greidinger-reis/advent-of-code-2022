# Advent of Code

### This is my [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) solutions.

AoC is a algorithm's puzzle platform that starts every year on dec. 1st, and gives you a two part puzzle on each day of the month.

I'm a fullstack web developer that is kinda addicted to typescript lol :D
So all solutions in here are in typescript.

### Runtime

I used [Deno](https://deno.land/) to quickly run the solutions on my machine.
Deno is a javascript runtime that has built-in support for typescript.
